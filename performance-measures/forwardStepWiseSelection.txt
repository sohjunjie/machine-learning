PSUEDO CODE

Initialize: ColumnList = NULL
    Out-of-sample-error = NULL
    Break X and Y into test and training sets
For number of column in X:
    For each trialColumn (column not in ColumnList):
        Build submatrix of X using ColumnList + trialColumn
        Train OLS on submatrix and store RSS Error on test data
    ColumnList.append(trialColumn that minimizes RSS Error)
    Out-of-sample-error.append(minimum RSS Error)
