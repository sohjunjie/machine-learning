Initialize: Out_of_sample_error = NULL
    Break X and Y into test and training sets
for i in range(number of columns in X):
    for each subset of X having i+1 columns:
        fit ordinary least squares model
    Out_of_sample_error.append(least error amoung subsets containing i+1 columns)
Pick the subset corresponding to least overall error
